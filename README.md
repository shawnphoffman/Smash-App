Smash-App [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/shawnphoffman/Smash-App.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/shawnphoffman/Smash-App)
=========

#### Companion app for the board game, Smash Up, and its related expansions.

## Features: 
- Add/Edit/Delete Players
- Enable Factions you want to play with / currently own
- Randomize enabled factions and pair them with current players
- Add/Subtract/Review points for the current game session and individual players

## Details
- Hastily built with shoddy BackboneJS, RequireJS, Framework7, jQuery, etc...

## Food fo' Thought:
    bower install
    npm install
    grunt 
  
## Grunt Tasks
- Currently, running grunt will combine the app-specific CSS files into a minified, production-ready CSS file and it will JSHint all of the app-specific JS files.
